                    <h2>Title: Keylogger: An Educational Exploration of Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
                    <pre> </pre>
                    <h3>Project Description</h3>
                    <p>The aim of this project was to create a keylogger using Python for educational purposes, 
                        specifically to better understand the security vulnerabilities that systems can face. 
                        A keylogger is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke 
                        typed on a specific computer's keyboard. Please note, this keylogger 
                        is intended to be used only for ethical and legal purposes.</p>
                    <pre> </pre>
                    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                    <p>The keylogger was developed using Python's 'pynput' library. 
                        When a key is pressed, an event is triggered and the key press is recorded to a file. 
                        The program operates in the background, and while it is running, 
                        it saves every key stroke to a text file.
                    </p>
                    <pre> </pre>
                    <h3>Code Explanation</h3>
                    <p>The code for the keylogger is straightforward, involving an implementation of a listener from the 'pynput' library to monitor keystrokes. 
                        </p>
                    <pre> </pre>
                    <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
                    <p>In the field of cybersecurity, it's crucial to understand that tools like keyloggers should only be used ethically and responsibly. While this project provides the tools to record keystrokes, 
                        it should never be used without the explicit permission of the computer's owner. 
                        Unauthorized use of a keylogger is illegal and unethical.</p>
                    <pre> </pre>
                    <h3>Countermeasures</h3>
                    <p>To protect against keyloggers, users can employ a variety of strategies including regularly updating and patching software, using a trusted antivirus or anti-malware program, and avoiding suspicious emails or websites.

                        Additionally, awareness plays a significant role in cybersecurity. Being aware of the potential risks and vulnerabilities can help guide safer practices, 
                        such as checking the source of email attachments and downloads, and keeping personal devices secure.</p>
