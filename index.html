Each piece of work is a testament to my relentless pursuit of excellence, detail-oriented mindset, and ability to think outside the box when addressing complex problems.</p>
                    <p>I have a keen interest in ethical hacking and love diving deep into the intricacies of secure system design and implementation. Whether it's hardening an organization's digital defenses or building an application with security as a priority, I thrive on challenges and revel in the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills.</p>
